## 📌 Executive Summary

**CloudBot** is a high-performance, full-stack, AI-powered commercial website assistant built for modern cloud service providers. Developed using a **deterministic, retrieval-based NLP matching architecture**, CloudBot delivers sub-20ms instant responses to commercial inquiries without requiring paid third-party generative AI APIs (such as OpenAI or Gemini), while providing an extensible hook for optional generative AI fallbacks.

The solution seamlessly embeds a floating interactive chat widget into a realistic cloud computing commercial website, featuring rich UI aesthetics, auto-scroll, quick prompt suggestions, typing indicators, user feedback mechanisms, and live analytics telemetry.
